I think I solved mysteries around hsq. I discovered more info about compression on wiki
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77
Our hsq is a kind of old well publishded Lampel Ziv algorithm. Methods like this are known as a dictionary coders.
I found same algos in unlzexe for dos, I have to suspect it would be lampel ziv, to save work with compressor/encoder.
Advanced encoders use KMP algorithm for pattern matching to work faster. I think, LZ77 encoding was very polular at end of past century.
Hsq compressor already posted is using simple intuitive match-comparison method, which is slower than KMP.

I hope I get some free time during christmass holiday. I would like to continue rewriting disassembled duneprg to C.

Do you know that zip is improvement of this algorithm? (zip stores dictionary in huffman tree)
Do you know that excelent lzma (7 zip) from Igor Pavlov is latest improvement of this type of compression?
From time to time some body learned about this algo and wrote new one improved (most of them was/are popular and famous)
