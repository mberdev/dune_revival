Now, it is time to figure the meaning of the different files
(and their file specifications).
All file names will be described in their original compressed state and original filename extension.
(Compressed HSQ/M32/AGD files can be unpacked with UNHSQ . )

Sounds:
SD1.HSQ -
SD2.HSQ - the turn over the page(s) sound from the Dune in-game book
SD3.HSQ - war sounds
SD4.HSQ - the water of life drop sound in the cave(s) where you can drink the water of life
SD5.HSQ -
SD6.HSQ -
SD7.HSQ -
SD8.HSQ -
SD9.HSQ -
SDA.HSQ - a nice low frequency sound from ... ???
SDB.HSQ - Paul - Usul Muadib- Atreides: "Father! The sleeper has awakened!" ( http://www.the-ocean...unds/awaken.wav )

The sound files in DUNE are stored in the "Creative Voice File" format.
The sounds will only be played if you chose: "Sound Blaster (music + sounds)" in the DUNE installation program before.

Music:

ARRAKIS.HSQ - default/standard background music in many Dune scenes
BAGDAD.HSQ
KURSK.HSQ
MORNING.HSQ
SEKENCE.HSQ
SIETCHM.HSQ
WARSONG.HSQ - TAKE AN ORNITHOPTER
WATER.HSQ - Scene: The Water of life cave inside a Sietch
WORMSUIT.HSQ - DUNE intro (with text/introduction/history)
WORMINTR.HSQ - DUNE intro (without text/introduction/history)

The mentioned HSQ files will be played if you chosed: "Adlib music card" or "Sound Blaster (music + sounds)" in in DUNE's Installation (hardware configuration/GAME CONFIGURATION).
After this, the dune.bat file calls/starts the DUNE ("DUNEPRG.exe") executable with on of the following switches:
+ ADL
+ SDB2207
(depending on the music/sound device which was set before.)


*.AGD - DUNE music with Adlib Gold instrumentation and for Adlib Gold compatible devices
If you chose "Adlib Gold music card" in DUNE's Installation(hardware configuration/GAME CONFIGURATION), then the dune.bat file starts the DUNE executable with the parameter "AGD388".
Then DUNE loads "DUNEAGD.hsq" at the beginning and before playing any kind of music.
The unpacked "DUNEAGD.hsq" seems to be a kind of DUNE music format file reader and player for the *.AGD files.

*.M32 - DUNE music with MT-32 instrumentation and for MT-32/LAPC1 compatible devices
If you chose "Roland MT-32 (LAPC1 midi card)" in DUNE's Installation(hardware configuration/GAME CONFIGURATION), then the dune.bat file starts the DUNE executable with the parameter "MID330".
Then DUNE loads "DUNEMID.HSQ" at the beginning and before playing any kind of music.
The unpacked "DUNEAGD.HSQ" seems to be a kind of DUNE music format file reader and player for the *.M32 files.
