DISCLAIMER:
-----------
  Although RDOSPLAY has been tested on several systems, I cannot guarantee that
it is bugless. Therefore I do not  take  responsibility for any damage directly
or indirectly caused by RDOSPLAY as a result of known/unknown  errors in it  or
errors caused by its access to your devices.


APOLOGIZE:
----------
  Sorry, english is not my  native language. However, I wrote this nice docy in
english without any help. I APOLOGIZE for any mistakes in the document. Take it
easy... Nobody is perfect.. :-)


PURPOSE OF RDOSPLAY:
--------------------
  RdosPlay is a OPL2/OPL3 music module player for IBM PC  compatible  computers
running MS-DOS operating system. This  means  that  you  can use it for playing
your  favorite  melody  from some music editor, demo or game. It is FIRST known
generic OPL player. I've coded it because of lack of any player of this type in
PC-world.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
  RdosPlay is coded in  pure 286-assembler  with  no 386+ optimalizations. This
means  you  can  use  your  old 286 and Adlib card for background playing while
doing some work. So The only required things  it needs  is  OPL2/3/4 compatible
card (Adlib or higher), 286 or higher and about 192kB of free mem. For  graphic
analyzers you would probably need at least 386-sx (not tested). The other thing
you need is some music module of course :-)


INSTALLATION OF RDOSPLAY:
-------------------------

- first  you have to make some directory on your drive. Then you have to unpack
  there archive file RPLYxyyz.ZIP. Don't forget  to  unpack it WITH directories
  otherwise you would get a pretty nice garbage :-)
  (you probably did all this when you read these lines :-)

- RDOSPLAY pack should consist of these files:

    RDOSPLAY.EXE - Main file - OPL player
    RDOSPLAY.DOC - Documentation for RdosPlay (this file)
    RDOSPLAY.REV - RDOSPLAY changes/revision history file
    FILE_ID.DIZ  - bbs file_id header
    FILES\*      - music module examples

- now you have RdosPlay successfully installed :-)


RDOSPLAY IN ACTION:
-------------------
  Rdosplay  uses  your  sound  card's  OPL chip  for  producing synthetic music
typical  for  these  chips. For  OPL2 (mono) musics it can also simulate stereo
by  distributing  channels  in left/right speakers. It's not possible with OPL3
musics  which  do  their  own (precise) panning. OPL2 stereo and OPL3 modes are
both possible only on OPL3 chip of course.
  When  producing  music  RdosPlay  also  shows  some  analyzers  to make world
brighter :-). This  can  be  supressed  when  using slow computers or slow OPL2
emulation (GUS users).


PROGRAM KEYS AND DIALOG LINE:
-----------------------------
While RdosPlay is running, you can use these keys:
  PgUp - increase track of music (for ADL only)
  PgDn - decrease track of music (for ADL only)

Dialog line looks as following:
  RDOSPLAY.EXE [/p] [/t] [/l] [/s] <musfile.ext>

  options:
    /pXXX:Y - specifies port and type of OPL chip (avoiding autodetection)
              XXX: hexadecimal base port of the chip
                Y: 1 = OPL2 (Adlib compatible)
                   2 = OPL3 (Yamaha YM262 stereo chip)
                   3 = OPL4 (Yamaha OPL4 stereo chip)
    /tXXX   - specifies track to be played (for ADL format only, 1-118)
    /s      - enables OPL3-stereo for OPL2 musics (omitted with OPL3 musics)
    /lX     - enables LED-meter on LPT port
              X: port number, where:
                 0 = 3BC (EGA's LPT port)
                 1 = 378 (standard LPT1 port)
                 2 = 278 (standard LPT2 port)

  RdosPlay  now  supports these formats (where are they and how to get them you
can read in another section):

  ú ADL (Adlib format similar to XMI)
  ú AGD (Herad system - DUNE game)              [OPL3]
  ú AMD (Amusic tracker packed files)
  ú CAL (ShadowLands game)
  ú D00 (JCH / Vibrants ver 1, 2 & 4)

  ú SAT (SAdT music composer)
  ú SDB (Herad system - DUNE / KGB games)
  ú SIG (SI system 2 - DIZZY games)
  ú VIB (JO/Vibrants player)

RdosPlay also supports some internal file packers. They are:
  ú HSQ (mainly with SDB,AGD - Dune game)
  ú SQX (mainly with SDB - KGB game)
  ú ICE (mainly with CAL - ShadowLands game)


MODULE GRABBING:
----------------

ú ADL

   This is  format  used  in  many games. Each  file  can  consist of up to 118
"tracks"  and  every  track  can  contain  separate  music. Default  track  for
RdosPlay is track number 1. Track can be  selected  with parameter /t. RdosPlay
will pack all used tracks so unused tracks won't be in selection field.


ú AMD

   This  extension  covers  files from Amusic tracker by Elyssis. There are two
types  of them. Packed and non-packed. RdosPlay currently supports packed files
only.


ú CAL

   This  standard  is  used  in  ShadowLands  game.  Look  there  and find file
TUNE.CAL. It's ICE-packed file and RdosPlay has internal ICE-unpacker.


ú D00

   These  files  are  for  JCH / Vibrants player. They are created in Vibrant's
editor  named  EdLib by packing standard *.EDL editor's files. Look for them in
intros or in that editor. Files for player ver 2+ begin with 'JCH' sign.
   Example: intro KUKKO2.EXE, offset B2A (module named CROONER.D00).


ú FXM

   These  files  are  special blocks of music code used in Fuxoft SoundTrack on
ZX Spectrum computer. This  computer  has  3-channel sound chip named AY3-8910.
RdosPlay  has  FXM interpreter and AY->OPL2 convertor. All the files that exist
in this format are supplied with RdosPlay standard distribution.


ú HSC

   HSC files are commonly used in short demos and intros. The source from where
they  came  is  mainly  HSC composer  which  is  available  on  anonymous FTP's
on I-net. There  you  can  get  most of these files (about 100 modules). If you
grab some file its extension must be HSC otherwise RdosPlay won't recognize it!


ú LDS

   These files are used in LOUDNESS system. Look  in  ZEPPELIN game's SOUND
directory and take all *.DAT files.


ú LEM

   These  files  are  used  in X-Mas Lemmings game. Grab  them  yourself. Their
sign is [0]=1C 52.


ú MUS

   This standard is used in FIRST SAMURAI game. Take file ADLIB.MUS.


ú PLX

   This standard is used in LOGICAL game. All  music  files  are stored in file
LOGICAL.EXE. You have  to  grab  them  from this file. Here are file positions:
13310, 165C0, 1B160, 1F320, 50360, 50550, 50730, 50990, 50B90, 50D10, 50FA0,
510F0, 51310, 56620, 59F90.


ú RAD

   This format came with Reality ADlib Tracker. Tunes often have  RAD extension
and if not, there is a 'RAD' sign at the beginning of the file.


ú RAW

   This format is very simple. It  consists  of  commands  directly sent to OPL
port. RAW format is used in STARPRT2.EXE intro (for example).
   format:   [0]=db     'RAWADATA'                 ... file identifier
             [8]=dw     clock                      ... clock (int8) speed
            [10]=dw     data_size dup (data)       ... adlib data
            [..]=dw     0ffffh                     ... end of file
   data: parameter, command.   command==0: data==n ... wait n times.
                               command==2: data==0 ... set speed (next word)
                               command==2: data==1 ... set OPL3 port A default
                               command==2: data==2 ... set OPL3 port B default

   This format is also generated by RAC (Rdos Adlib Catcher).


ú SAT

   These  files are made in SAdT music composer. They begin with 'SAdT' sign.


ú SDB, AGD

   These files are used in DUNE game. Look  in  game's directory and search for
*.SDB  or  *.AGD  files.  These  are  HSQ-packed.  You  can  unpack  them  with
UNHSQ (RDOS production)  or  use  them  as  they are. RdosPlay has internal HSQ
unpacker and recognizes both packed or unpacked modules. *.AGD files have to be
played on OPL-3  stereo  music  chip (that's why /s parameter doesn't work with
them), *.SDB are for standard AdLib (OPL-2) card.


ú SIG

   These  files  are used in DIZZY games. They are stored in main .EXE file and
you have to grab them. Here are  their respective filenames, offsets and sizes:
  FFOOD=6464E,3B38  KWIKSNAX=73C2E,2BC4  MAGICLND=689EE,4508  YOLK=6571E,33FD


ú VIB

   This is standard used in player by JO / Vibrants.
   Example: intro COPPER.EXE, offset 8990.


RDOSPLAY FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
------------------------------------

* RdosPlay have not detected my soundcard although I have OPL2 compatible card.
- You have to set sound card manually (ie. /p parameter).
- GUS users with SBOS running may use /p388:1.

* RdosPlay sounds HORRIBLE on GUS !
- That's the fault of OPL2 emulation on GUS, not mine. You have to stay with it
  or to wait until REMUS (Rdos Emulation Sound system) is released. It will
  bring a brand new OPL3 emulation for your GUS (hopefully).

* I have D/A converter (PC Speaker), does RdosPlay support it ?
- No, It does not. You have to wait until REMUS is released.

* I have some SAT modules and it seems some of them aren't played correctly
  with RdosPlay.
- Yes, it's the fault of RdosPlay's SAT playing routine. I have to improve it.

* What about a fileselector in RdosPlay ?
- It's currently in development, wait for new RdosPlay release.

* Why are sometimes FXM modules played incorrectly (i mean drums) ?
- Not 100% right FXM interpreter initialization causes that noise channel of
  adlib card is not initialized at all. FXM player is undergoing recontruction
  now. Wait for another release.
